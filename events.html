    <p> Insulin for the Soul has been putting an 5k run/walks since the organization started in 2016. This is a way for us to get out into the community, do our own fundraising, and get tons of families involved who are involved with diabetes or not! Usually our run/walks start up in late April, go through summer and end right around Halloween.</p>
    
    
    <p2> Since our organization is based out of Central, IL, we stay relatively around this area. But, as our ogranization grows, we hope to go even farther in the future.</p2>
    
    <p3> Many of our candidates are filtered in from the area and are often patients with the Springfield Clinic on West Carpentar Street in Springfield, IL. With this, the clinic and us work together to promote and they help fund us when we need it. </p3>
    <h2> What to Expect At an Event</h2>
    <p4> At our run/walk events, you can register online prior to the event on our website or in person on the day of the event up until 30 minutes prior to the start of the race. IF you registered prior, come to the welcome table and get signed in for the day. There is always food and goodies, an information booth, and fun games to participate in and collect prizes! The winner of the 5k run/walk will receive a medal plaque, while every participant will receive a goody bag at the end. Depending on how long the race lasts, afterwards we gather and thank everyone for coming and participating and fellowhship afterwards is always welcomed. The information booth has basic info on our organization and what we do, who is being sponsored, and donation pledges you can make on site. 
    </p4>
     
    <p5> While our run/walk season is ending for fall, we do have a few more events left! </p5>
