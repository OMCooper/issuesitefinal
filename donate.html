    <h1> Donate</h1>
    <p> Why donate? Your donation can help us fund insulin needs for diabetics and families that need aid paying for their insulin, a daily need for diabetics. Insulin prices out of pocket can sum up to nearly $500-600 a month without the proper insurance. The daily struggle and worry that can come from just needing to pay for insulin, a DAILY need for a diabetic, can add up. So, help us help them. </p>
      <p> We can sponsor up to eight diabetics and their families for roughly two years at a time, once the two years is up, we keep in contact to see how the aid has gone for them and what progress they have been through. Right now, we only have three candidates. </p>
    <p> You are welcomed to donate right to our organization 
or choose one of our participants to pledge a donation too directly
