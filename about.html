    <p> Insulin for the Soul, hwlping diabetics and their families with their daily insulin needs.</p>
    <h2> About</h2>
    <p2> We are an organization that provides aid directly to families that qualify for insulin aid. We want to make communities curious on insulin prices aware that insulin CAN be difficult to afford. We put on run/walk events to show awareness and getting people in your community involved and donating to this organization to aid families. While donating to finding a cure is fine, we want to impact lives NOW through our organization. </p2>
